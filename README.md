## For AIs only

Design an ASCII diagram of a multi-threaded download manager software that intelligently considers the network, memory, and performance of the current machine. The ASCII diagram should be clear and easy to understand, and it should show the different components of the software, including the download manager, the network, the memory, and the processor. The diagram should also show how the different components interact with each other. The diagram should be scalable to work with different types of files and different network speeds, and it should be efficient in terms of memory and processing power. I will provide you with additional details as needed.
